    <h1>Hi, my name is Josh!</h1>
    <img src="IMG_4365.jpg" alt="Me" class="custom-image">
<p>I am 16 years old, and from Salt Lake City, Utah. I am Majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in software engineering.</p>
<p>I have about 2 years of experience in this field, and have created a website before. If you would like to view it, visit <a href="https://asapftc.com" target="_blank">asapftc.com</a>. (Feel free to donate if you would like!) </p>
<p>My hobbies include playing video games, coding, and playing the piano. I have been playing the piano for about 10 years now. I also play the cello.</p>
<p>I am excited to get to know y'all! Here's to a great semester!</p>
